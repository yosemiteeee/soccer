<h2> About Chelsea FC </h2>
<p>
  Chelsea Football Club is an English professional football club based in Fulham, Chelsea in London. Founded in 1905, they compete in the Premier League, the top division of English football. Chelsea are among England's most successful clubs, having won over thirty competitive honours, including 6 top-flight titles, 8 FA Cups, 5 League Cups, 2 UEFA Europa Leagues, 2 UEFA Cup Winners' Cups, 1 UEFA Champions League, and 1 UEFA Super Cup. Their home ground is Stamford Bridge.[4]
  Chelsea won their first major honour, the League Championship, in 1955. They won the FA Cup for the first time in 1970 and their first European honour, the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup, in 1971. After a period of decline in the late 1970s and 1980s, the club enjoyed a revival in the 1990s and had more success in cup competitions. The past two decades have been the most successful in Chelsea's history: they won five of their six league titles and the UEFA Champions League during this period.[5] Chelsea are one of five clubs to have won all three of UEFA's main club competitions, and the only London club to have won the Champions League.
